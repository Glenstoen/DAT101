      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				[You should use constants whereever the valus is not supposed to change. Variables should be used when the value is expected to change. Not all values can be constants, for example a counter in a loop needs to be a variable.]
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[parentheses affects the order of operations, the parentheses are calculated first, followed by multiplication and division etc.]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[You can use the toFixed() method to limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals.]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[You can compare two floating-point values by rounding them to a certain number of decimal places using the toFixed() method, and then comparing the rounded values.]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[Comparison operators return either TRUE or FALSE. You can check the result of a comparison operator by using it in an if statement or by logging the result to the console or printing it out.]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[Math.random will give a random number. It can be used for generating random numbers, or selecting random items from a list.]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[Modulus (%) is an operator that returns the remainder of a division operation. It is useful for determining if a number is even or odd.]
